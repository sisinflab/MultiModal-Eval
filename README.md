## Pre-requisites

We implemented and tested our models in `PyTorch==1.12.0`, with CUDA `10.2` and cuDNN `8.0`. Additionally, some of graph-based models require `PyTorch Geometric`, which is compatible with the versions of CUDA and `PyTorch` we indicated above.

## Installation

### Local
If you have the possibility to install CUDA on your workstation (i.e., `10.2`), you may create the virtual environment with the requirement files we included in the repository, as follows:

```sh
# PYTORCH ENVIRONMENT (CUDA 10.2, cuDNN 8.0)

$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements_torch_geometric.txt
```

### Docker
A more convenient way of running experiments is to instantiate a docker container having CUDA `10.2` already installed. Make sure you have Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed on your machine (you may refer to this [guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installing-on-ubuntu-and-debian)). Then, you may use the following Docker image to instantiate the container equipped with CUDA `10.2` and cuDNN `8.0`: [link](https://hub.docker.com/layers/nvidia/cuda/10.2-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu18.04/images/sha256-3d1aefa978b106e8cbe50743bba8c4ddadacf13fe3165dd67a35e4d904f3aabe?context=explore).
